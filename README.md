cookbook
========

A fancy, HTML5-y reimagining of the common cookbook.

Hosting
-------

I'm not hosting this anywhere right now, but you can test it out by firing up a local webserver. Python's built-in one works fine. Download and unzip the cookbook, then run one of these from the unzipped directory:

### python3
`python3 -m http.server`

### python2
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

Recipes
------
The recipe in the demo is the [Toll House Chocolate Cookie Recipe](http://www.verybestbaking.com/recipes/18476/Original-NESTLE-TOLL-HOUSE-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies/detail.aspx)
